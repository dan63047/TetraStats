It provides full Tetra League leaderboard, allowing Tetra Stats to sort leaderboard by any metric and build scatter chart, that allows user to analyse Tetra League trends. It also provides history of Tetra League ranks cutoffs, which can be viewed by user via graph as well.\n\nThere is a plans to add replay analysis and tournaments history, so stay tuned!\n\nService is not associated with TETR.IO or osk in any capacity.",
